# Air-Quality-Index-Predictor

## Overview
This project aims to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Bangalore city using machine learning models. The dataset used in this project contains AQI information from the year 2013 to 2018. The goal is to build and evaluate various models to accurately predict AQI values.

## Data
The project utilizes a dataset containing AQI information of Bangalore city from 2013 to 2018. The dataset includes features such as temperature, AQI and other relevant environmental parameters.

## Models
The following machine learning models are used in this project:
- Linear Regression
- XGBoost Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

Hyperparameter tuning is performed for each of the above models to improve their performance.

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure the dataset containing AQI information is in the correct format.
2. **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and identify key patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create and select relevant features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Training**: Run the provided Jupyter notebook to train the models (Linear Regression, XGBoost Regressor, Random Forest Regressor) on the dataset.
5. **Prediction**: Use the trained models to predict AQI values.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tune the hyperparameters of the models to achieve the best performance.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics to determine their accuracy and effectiveness.

## Results
The project aims to achieve accurate predictions of the Air Quality Index, which can be used for monitoring and managing air quality in Bangalore city.
